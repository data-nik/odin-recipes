# odin-recipes 
This is going to be my first project and test of all the things that I have learned so far in The Odin Project over the period of about 2 and a half weeks of study. I should be displaying the ability to understand enough in HTML and CSS to complete a simple recipe webpage for the instructions on how to properly prepare a cup of coffee using the pour over method.
